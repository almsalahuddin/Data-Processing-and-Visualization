        "The timely topic I have chosen for the review data visualization is \"The COVID-19 Economy’s Effects on Food, Housing, and Employment Hardships\". First, In January 20, 2020 CDC confirms the first U.S. laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. from samples taken on January 18 in Washington state. Since then till now, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a devastating loss of life but it has also devastated the nation's economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic fallout caused significant hardship. In the early months of the crisis, tens of millions of people lost their jobs. While employment began to rebound within a few months, unemployment remained high throughout 2020. Improving employment and substantial relief measures helped reduce the very high levels of hardship seen in the summer of 2020. Nonetheless, considerable unmet need remained near the end of 2021, with 20 million households reporting having too little to eat in the past seven days and 10 million households behind on rent. In early 2022, some 3 million fewer people are employed than before the pandemic, though steady progress has been made, including in recent months."

This graph is also made of using same colored bars but insted they could use different colors to show different group of race. Also, they didn't include month and year of the datas in their graph. They used percentage on the y axis and then also annotated percentages again on the top of the each graph which was not necessary. Instead, they could use month and a year. This graph also could have been a line graph like 1st referenced graph instead of bar garph with the month and year included on the x axis."
